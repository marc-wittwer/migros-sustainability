# ZooMania
People are generally interested in sustainable products, however, the shopping experience is not designed in a way to encourage such actions.
ZooMania makes sustainable purchases easier and more fun - by nudging consumers toward more sustainable alternatives. Kids can collect digital animals when they make their parents buy more sustainable products through ZooMania. The more their parents buy sustainable products, the more rare animals the kids will get, which they can use to collect or to trade.

Open the ios/migros-sustainabilty.xcodeworkspace project in Xcode.
Make sure the target is set to Movies and that you have an iOS simulator selected to run the app.
